 ## Services
 
Angular 1 => One Injector for One app

Global Services can be defined in bootstraps second argument in main.ts. => You don't need to use providers in components

 providers
 
 Dependency Injection:
  constructor(name: Service) {
  
  }
  
 @Injectable() allow to inject Services into Services (from angular2/core)
 
 bootstrap(app, [FriendService, provide(FriendsConfig, {useValue/useClass/useFactory})]); to inject custom
 
 for each class
